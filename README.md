"BadUSB" for employers to test the awareness of their own employees using a Pico

I am a senior in college, doing my capstone. 
A small part of the project I chose to do is a "BadUSB" for employers to 
test the awareness of their own employees. 
I want the Pico to be harmless, but I want it to Get 'Computer+Name' 
and send an email or notification to me AKA the employer or boss. 
I can do email but the example I have seen want me to add the senders email, 
but with even 5 employees per say I don't know which one will plug it in. 
Maybe I could have the code Get an email and append the code to add 
it as the sender address? There is no need to get any truly vital information, 
just want to know which of the employees will be subject to having to go 
through training material for failing the internal audit. LET ME KNOW!!!!
