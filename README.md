"BadUSB" for employers to test the awareness of their own employees using a Pico

I am a senior in college, doing my capstone. 
A small part of the project I chose to do is a "BadUSB" for employers to 
test the awareness of their own employees. 

**NOTE**
AWS CLI needs to be installed
A console.aws account needs to be created
Search Amazon Simple Email Service
Select the 'SMTP settings' button in the left panel
Then 'Create SMTP credentials'
This will navigate you to the IAM service
Keep the IAM User Name that it creates for you
Then Click 'Show User SMTP Security Credentials'
-Create a text document and save the SMTP Username and SMTP Password in the document-
**Retrun to SES Tab**
Click the 'Verified identities' Tab
Click 'Create identity' (Create the Senders identity first, can be any email you would like to be the sender, I created a Gmail one)
Click 'Email address' type the email address out in the bar
After creating the Sender email, click the Authentication Tab and click 'Edit' under Custom MAIL FROM domain and use custom subdomain, I did something similar to my gmail. (Example: blankblank@gmail.com / Subdomain: blank.blank.gmail.com)
*I am not sure if doing this is neccessary tbh but its on mine that worked so I dont want to leave it out*
Click on the 'Services' button in the Top Left and Type 'IAM' then click on the 'Users' Tab and Click 'Add users'
Under 'User name' type something similar to the email (Example: blankblank)
Check 'Provide user access to the AWS Management Console - *optional*'
This is to your own descretion: Then check 'I want to create an IAM user' then Keep 'Autogenerated password' checked
This is to your own descretion: Uncheck Users must create a new password at next sign-in (recommended)
Click 'Next' then click 'Attach policies directly' Search 'AmazonSESFullAccess' then click Next and Next.
Under Retrieve password click 'Show' under Console password. In a text document add the consule username, sign-in URL and Console password.
Click 'Return to users list' and Click on the new user you created, Under the Groups Tab I Added the user to a group I named 'Training' not sure if it was necessary.
Then under 'Security credentials' Tab scroll down and click 'Create access key' 


Then click on the 'Authorization' Tab and click 'Create policy' and click 'Use policy generator'
Under Effect click 'Allow' and under Principles add your IAM user number (Example looks like this: arn:aws:ses:us-west-1:135274132835:identity/krytechcyber@gmail.com
